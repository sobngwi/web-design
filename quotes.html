    <h3>What is HTML?</h3>

    <blockquote>
	<p>HTML is a markup language. The word markup was used by editors who marked up manuscripts (usually with a blue pencil) when giving instructions for revisions. The term remains in use, though with slightly different meaning. A markup language as it relates to browsers is a language with specific syntax that gives intructions to a web browser about how to display a page. HTML separates "content" (words, images, audio, video, and so on) from "presentation" (the definition of the type of content and the instructions for how that type of content should be displayed). HTML uses a pre-defined set of elements to identify content types. Elements contain one or more "tags" that contain or express content. Tags are surrounded by angle brackets, and the "closing" tag (the one that indicates the end of the content) is prefixed by a forward slash.</p>
