  	<p>“One, remember to look up at the stars and not down at your feet. Two, never give up work. Work gives you meaning and purpose and life is empty without it. Three, if you are lucky enough to find love, remember it is there and don't throw it away.”</p>

  	<p>― Stephen Hawking</p>

  	<p>“What really knocks me out is a book that, when you're all done reading it, you wish the author that wrote it was a terrific friend of yours and you could call him up on the phone whenever you felt like it. That doesn't happen much, though.”</p>

	<h3>What is HTML?</h3>

	<p>HTML is a markup language. The word markup was used by editors who marked up manuscripts (usually with a blue pencil) when giving instructions for revisions. The term remains in use, though with slightly different meaning. A markup language as it relates to browsers is a language with specific syntax that gives intructions to a web browser about how to display a page. HTML separates "content" (words, images, audio, video, and so on) from "presentation" (the definition of the type of content and the instructions for how that type of content should be displayed). HTML uses a pre-defined set of elements to identify content types. Elements contain one or more "tags" that contain or express content. Tags are surrounded by angle brackets, and the "closing" tag (the one that indicates the end of the content) is prefixed by a forward slash.</p>
