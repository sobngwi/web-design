      <h1>Early Attempts at Aerial Navigation.</h1>

	<p>The first free and unfettered balloon voyage was performed very soon after the event mentioned at the end of the last chapter. It was a daring attempt, and attended with great danger.</p>

	<p>A balloon made by Montgolfier was used. It was <span class="highligh"> 75 feet high, 45 feet wide</span>, and spheroidal in form—heated air being the motive power. The bold aeronauts, on this occasion, were the naturalist Rozier and the Marquis d’Arlandes, a major of infantry. From the gardens of the Château of Muetta they ascended on the 21st November 1783.</p>
